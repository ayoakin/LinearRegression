# Linear Regression From Scratch UsingÂ Matrices
## Project Overview
This project recreates a linear regression algorithm from scratch using two python libraries - pandas and numpy for matrix operations. It then compares it to the linear regression implementation from scikit-learn. The dataset used is a two column salary dataset with 30 rows. The independent variable "YearsExperience" details the number of years of job experience. The dependent variable "Salary" details the salary earned.

Recreating the linear regression algorithm gives the benefit of

* understanding what happens under the hood of the algorithm
* understanding why and if a prediction for a dataset is best using linear regression
* model customization
